# COVID-19 Case Trends and State-Level Analysis in the United States | Summer 2020 Dynamics
***

## Project Overview ☰

This project analyzes US COVID-19 confirmed case data from March through September 2020. It examines state-level trends, summer case increases, weekly averages, and the proportion of national cases per state. The goal is to provide actionable insights into pandemic dynamics across states and territories for public health monitoring, reporting, and data-driven decision-making.

## Key Takeaways 🔎

       ✓ Identified states with the highest numerical and percentage increases in COVID-19 cases over the summer months  
       ✓ Highlighted states with the highest average weekly increases during the early summer period  
       ✓ Tracked the proportion of national cases occurring in New York and other major states from March to August 2020  
       ✓ Revealed state-level trends in case growth to inform comparative analysis  
       ✓ Provided clear visualizations for policymakers, researchers, and public health analysts  

## Key Features 🔑

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

       ✓ Aggregate confirmed COVID-19 cases by US state/territory  
       ✓ Compute numerical and percentage increases in cases over summer months (July–September 2020)  
       ✓ Calculate 7-day average case increases for eight-week periods  
       ✓ Analyze state-level contributions to national case totals  
       ✓ Visualize trends with line and area plots for top states  

* **Derived Insights:**

       ✓ Texas had the highest numerical case increase over summer 2020  
       ✓ Virgin Islands had the highest percentage case increase over the same period  
       ✓ New York had the highest average weekly increase among states during early summer  
       ✓ Tracked proportion of national cases in New York and other major states over spring and summer months  
       ✓ Enabled comparisons of pandemic trends across multiple states  

## Visualizations 📶

       ✓ Line plots showing numerical and percentage case increases per state  
       ✓ Area plots visualizing cumulative case growth and proportional contributions  
       ✓ Line and area plots of weekly average case increases over eight weeks  
       ✓ Comparative plots of state-level proportions of national cases from March to August 2020
